    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end
    (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will
    be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and
    practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.<br>
    <h2> Topics:</h2>
    ❖ The Web and Web Application <br>
    ❖ Client-side Web Development with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript <br>
    ❖ Server-side Web Application Development with PHP and Database (MySQL) <br>
    ❖ Version control (git) and DevOps <br>
    ❖ Web Application Security: Vulnerabilities and Attacks with Hands-on Exercises <br>
    ❖ Secure Web Programming Principles and Practices <br>
    <h2>Hands-on Projects: </h2>
    <p>In this we done 3 labs, 1 hackthon, and 1 Individual project. In summary, In the labs had worked hands-on cloning and creating git hub repository.<br>
    In lab 1 we obsereved the HTTP protocols using Wireshark, and telnet.<br>In lab 2 we created a basic html page, with analog clock, written in jquery and digital clock. With joke api integration, covered HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery, JSON, did some backend with echo.php file for GET POST requests and with AJAX.
    In Hackthon did hands-on Level 06 XSS attacks and gave input validation for defense of the lab 1 webpage. <br> In this individual project 1 created a professional profile webpage with some features from lab1 and added 2 webapis with jquery, js, another web api with react js. Used bootstrap for template.</p>

    <h2>Course Goals and Objectives: </h2>
    <h3>Students will have the ability to:</h3>
    ❖ obtain the ability and skills to effectively use state-of-the-art techniques in web application
    development and security tools for the analysis, design, and implementation of secure web
    systems <br>
    ❖ enhance students programming skills to develop secure, robust, sustainable software products <br>
    ❖ establish security analysis skills to identify and avoid potential web vulnerabilities <br>
    ❖ identify the types of security threats and perform attacks in web applications and adopt
    corresponding countermeasures to prevent such attacks <br>
    ❖ obtain the ability and skills to apply practical knowledge of security in designing and
    implementing web applications with contemporary programming technologies.<br>
    <h2>Course Outcomes:</h2>
    <h3> Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: </h3><br>
    ❖ design, implement, and evaluate a web-based solution to meet a given set of computing
    requirements in the context of the programs discipline <br>
    ❖ understand the principle aspects of concepts of web application security <br>
    ❖ identify and discuss the types of security threats and attacks in web applications and practical
    experience with hands-on exercises <br>
    ❖ adopt corresponding countermeasures to identified threats in web applications and argue their
    effectiveness <br>
    ❖ apply practical knowledge of security in designing and implementing web applications with
    contemporary technologies <br><br><br>
